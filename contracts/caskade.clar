; Caskade - Bitcoin-native micro reward protocol on Stacks
;; Version: 1.0.0
;;
;; Caskade is a decentralized micro-reward protocol built on the
;; Stacks blockchain.
;;
;; It enables users to accrue STX rewards with optional messages to
;; creators, developers, and contributors.
;;
;; The protocol records reward activity, tracks user statistics,
;; and collects a small protocol fee to support sustainability.
;;
;; Caskade provides transparent on-chain metrics such as:
;; - Total accruals across the protocol
;; - Total transaction volume
;; - User reward statistics
;; - Protocol revenue accumulation
;;
;; The goal of Caskade is to create a simple and transparent way
;; to support contributors using Bitcoin-secured micro-payments.
